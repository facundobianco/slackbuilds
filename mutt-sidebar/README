Mutt is a small but very powerful text-based MIME mail client.  Mutt
is highly configurable, and is well suited to the mail power user with
advanced features like key bindings, keyboard macros, mail threading,
regular expression searches and a powerful pattern matching language
for selecting groups of messages.

This version includes the sidebar patch and the nntp patch (optional).

NNTP (Network News Transfer Protocol) is not compiled by default. If 
you want mutt to compile with NNTP capabilities, run the script as 
follows: NNTP=yes ./mutt-sidebar.Slackbuild
